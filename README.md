Sample ScriptCraft scripts used at CoderDojo McDonough


Game of Life
============

[life.js](life.js) implements [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) in Minecraft using [ScriptCraft](http://scriptcraftjs.org/).  Cells are generated on a 2D grid of Minecraft blocks.  The delay between generations can be adjusted by the "delay" variable.

Example function call to start a Glider with 50 generations at the mouse position: 

    /js life(50)

Works best on a flat world.
